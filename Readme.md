It's a working tweeter like project.

Basic functionality has been implemented.
You can register new users and log in as an existing user, while all necessary fields are validated.
You can browse tweets, you can browse other user tweets, you can browse comments or add a comment yourself. 
User can also send messages to each other, and messages are displayed according to their status (marked as read or unread).
All this functionality is available only to logged users.

Big downside at the moment is its fugly layout.
TO DO - improve layout.
